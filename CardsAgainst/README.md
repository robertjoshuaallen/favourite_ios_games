## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

* [PeerKit](https://github.com/jpsim/PeerKit) for event-driven, zero-config Multipeer Connectivity
* [Cartography](https://github.com/robb/Cartography) for layout
* [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVProgressHUD) for HUDs

## Offensive Content

Running this game from source will use a small, very mild, impossible to offend subset of the Cards Against Humanity cards.

However, simply set `let pg13 = false` in [CardManager.swift](https://github.com/jpsim/CardsAgainst/blob/master/CardsAgainst/Controllers/CardManager.swift#L11) to gain access to the entirety of the card collection.
